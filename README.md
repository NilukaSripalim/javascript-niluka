# What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is indeed one of the most popular and widely used programming languages worldwide. It is currently experiencing rapid growth, surpassing other programming languages in popularity. Major companies such as Netflix, Walmart, and PayPal rely on JavaScript to develop complete applications.

# What can you do with JavaScript?
JavaScript used to be primarily used in web browsers to create interactive web pages. Some developers considered it a toy language during that time. However, things have changed significantly due to the strong support from the JavaScript community and significant investments from major companies like Facebook and Google.

Today, JavaScript has evolved into a versatile language that can be used to build complete web and mobile applications. It is also capable of powering real-time networking applications such as chat systems and video streaming services. Moreover, JavaScript can be utilized to create command-line tools and even games. Its capabilities have expanded beyond the web, making it a powerful and widely applicable programming language.

# Where does JavaScript code run?
JavaScript was originally designed to function exclusively in web browsers. Each browser contains a JavaScript engine responsible for executing JavaScript code. For instance, Firefox uses the SpiderMonkey engine, while Chrome uses the V8 engine.


In 2009, a talented engineer named Ryan Dahl took the open-source V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome and integrated it into a C++ program. This program was named Node. Node is essentially a C++ program that incorporates Google's V8 JavaScript engine. This breakthrough allowed JavaScript code to be executed outside of a browser, enabling the creation of back-ends for web and mobile applications.


In summary, JavaScript code can be executed within a browser environment or in Node. Browsers and Node provide the necessary runtime environment for running JavaScript code beyond the confines of a web browser.

# What is the difference between JavaScript and ECMA Script?
ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES) is a specification for a scripting language, and JavaScript is a programming language that follows this specification. The organization responsible for defining these standards is called ECMA.

The first version of ECMAScript was released in 1997, and it served as the foundation for JavaScript. In 2015, a significant update to ECMAScript was released, known as ECMAScript 2015 or ES6 for short. This update introduced many new features and improvements to the JavaScript language, making it more powerful and versatile. Since then, ECMA has been working on annual releases of new ECMAScript specifications, continuously enhancing the JavaScript language.
